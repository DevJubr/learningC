# Conditions in C

This repository provides an introduction to conditional statements in the C programming language. Conditional statements are essential for controlling the flow of a program based on specific conditions or criteria.

## Introduction

Conditional statements in C allow you to make decisions in your program. You can execute different blocks of code depending on whether a given condition is true or false. This README explains the basic concepts and usage of conditional statements in C.

## What You'll Find Here

1. **if Statements**: Learn how to use the `if` statement for basic conditional execution.

2. **if-else Statements**: Explore the `if-else` statement for branching between two code paths.

3. **if-else if-else Statements**: Understand how to use multiple conditions with `else if` to create more complex branching logic.

4. **switch Statements**: Discover how to use the `switch` statement for efficient branching based on the value of an expression.

## Usage

This repository provides code examples and explanations for each type of conditional statement. You can clone the repository and explore the code to gain a better understanding of how conditional statements work in C.
